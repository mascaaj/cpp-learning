Notes
------

- Wrap all string values in single brackets.
- String array needs escape characters '\0'
- Multi array has row col assignment.
- Reading incorrect / unassigned value, will throw garbage.
- prefix operator (++x) changes the variable immediately, postfix (x++) changes subsequently.
- If logic is similar to python::

    if (x == true){}

    //can be written as:

    if (x){}
